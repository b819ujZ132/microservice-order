# Sample - Order Microservice
Compiling, but untested.

## TODOs
* Evolve microservice to support all desired MVP functionality (create, attach products and complete).
* Swap to manual mapper that does not leverage reflection.
* Swap to model library.
* Add swagger annotations all throughout project.
* Finishing hooking up to AWS Secrets and RDS instance.
* Swap session support to consumable AWS client (AWS Session State service).
* Add product support via consumable client (considering SOAP to showcase WCF).
* Confirm Docker integration.
* Add validators.
* Add test project with unit tests.
