* Finishing hooking up to AWS Secrets and RDS instance.
* Swap session support to consumable client (considering SOAP to showcase WCF).
* Add product support via consumable client (considering SOAP to showcase WCF).
* Confirm Docker integration.
* Add validators.
* Add test project with unit tests.
